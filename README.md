# MedDonor

MedDonor is a web application designed to work involving community members and those working in the health sector. Community members are able to donate the equipment to local clinics or hospitals as per their criteria and policies. On the other hand, health professionals are asked to use this application to report the equipment they have and the equipment they need. Community members are able to view this information and gain access to the place they wish to donate to.

## Inspiration 

During the brainstorming process, our team knew that we want COVID-19 to be our focus because even small contributions can make a big difference to this pandemic. We came up with many ideas that have not been implemented, would be useful, and most importantly, is realistic for the given time period. As mentioned in the challenge statement, we were asked to tackle a social issue that we believe could be solved through technology. After understanding the situation, we prioritized all ideas and decided to focus on scarce equipment in our healthcare industry. To ensure there is efficient distribution of resources (i.e. masks, gloves, thermometers, etc...), we are offering a solution where community members are able to donate their excess equipment to clinics or hospitals according to their needs.

## Challenges 

Though we are familiar with many technologies, we decided to tackle this issue by exploring new tools and technologies. Our group is currently challenged to learn how to find nearby clinics and hospitals using Google's Place Api and to learn how to use Firebase for login authentication and RTDB for store relevant information such as list and quantity of equipment.
